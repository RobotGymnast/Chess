Before you start development, please set up your pre-commit hook. You can do
this by either copying scripts/pre-commit to .git/hooks/pre-commit, or simply
making a symlink. This will ensure that the project builds and passes all tests
before being committed.

## Dependencies

- FieldTrip  (future) - eeeh no. Last modified in 2009. I don't think so.
